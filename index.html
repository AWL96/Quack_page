    <p>
      Hi there,<br><br>
      You're most likely visiting this page because you've encountered its URL in my probes that you investigated.
      The reason for these probes is because I'm currently working on a research project where I'm measuring the reachability of middleboxes (i.a. within your network).
      To this end, I'm sending packets with a <em>very</em> small <code>HTTP GET</code> request to various IP addresses and observe the responses.
      To limit the impact on the network/end-hosts, the experiments are <em>spaced</em> out over several days and are performed at a <em>low</em> bandwidth.

    <p>
      I'm a graduate student focused on studying (networked) computer systems.
      If you have any questions about my project or would like me to exclude your network from my tests, please contact me at <code>skater5@live.nl</code> with the subject prefix <code>[middleboxes]</code>.
      I will try to answer within five working days.
